# Contributing to coteafs-parent.

:+1: :tada: Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :+1:

The following are set of guidelines for contributing towards this framework on Github. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code Contribution

## 1. Where to start from?

If you've noticed a bug or have a question please check the [search the issue tracker][tracker] to see if someone else has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and [add one][new issue]!

## 2. Want to fix an issue or add new feature?

If this is something you think you can fix, then follow the following steps:

### Step 1: Discuss

Before jumping on any ticket or any feature which you think should be there in the framework, discuss with me on my [site][] or email me @ wasbhamla2005@gmail.com. Once you get go-ahead, you can proceed by following the steps mentioned hereafter.

### Step 2: Setup your E-mail in Git

Assuming you have already done this. But if you are new and may forget this, you can do it as described [here][setup].

### Step 3: Fork and clone the repository

To Fork and clone the repository, see this useful [post][fork].

### Step 4: Create new Branch

Now create a new branch with descriptive name in your forked repo. Refer [here][branch] to know about Git branches.

### Step 5: Commit with a descriptive message

If committing a fix for a ticket, always start with `Fixed #[Ticket ID]` than describe the changes in detail.
For an example on how to write a proper commit message, see [this][commitHelp] post.

### Step 6: Push changes to your cloned fork

After committing the changes, you need to push the commit to your cloned repo by executing `git push origin your-branch-name` command in the terminal.

### Step 7: Send Pull Request

Sending Pull Request will be the last step of your contribution. To know how to raise a Pull Request, see [this][pr] post.

> **NOTE:** From your second contribution onwards, you can skip steps **(1) and (2)**.

## Issues and Suggestions.

If you find any issue in the project or you have any suggestion for enhancement, please feel free to raise a ticket for it. Together we can make the project even more effective and easy for other Test Engineers to use it in their daily automation tasks.
